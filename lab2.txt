1. Gas() used increamentSpeed() with amount between 0 and 1, while Break() uses decrementSpeed  with amount between 0 and 1.

The two classes follow LSP but there is something that is that they both contain different methods apart from gas() and break() so it is not possible to switch between them at the time we want unless the common methods between them are used such as gas() and break().


2. First, I created a class called Storage, which contains some functions related to load and unload car. After that, the method of load the car is similar between the transport and the CarRepairShop in terms of the nearby, I used the same functions loadCars and unloadCars from Storage class. So delegation Delegation used in Transport and CarRepairShop when we send carloadW and carUnloadW.
